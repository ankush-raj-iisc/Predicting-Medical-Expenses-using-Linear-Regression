# Predicting-Medical-Expenses-using-Linear-Regression
An Insurance Co. offers affordable health insurance to thousands of customer all over the United States. As the lead data scientist, I'm tasked with creating an automated system to estimate the annual medical expenditure for new customers, using information such as their age, sex, BMI, children, smoking habits and region of residence.  
Estimates from my system will be used to determine the annual insurance premium (amount paid every month) offered to the customer. Due to regulatory requirements, I must be able to explain why your system outputs a certain prediction.
I'm given a CSV file containing verified historical data, consisting of the aforementioned information and the actual medical charges incurred by over 1300 customers.
# Objective
Our objective is to find a way to estimate the value in the "charges" column using the values in the other columns. If we can do so for the historical data, then we should able to estimate charges for new customers too, simply by asking for information like their age, sex, BMI, no. of children, smoking habits and region.

# The following steps are involved in this project:
1. A typical problem statement for machine learning
2. Downloading and exploring a dataset for machine learning
3. Linear regression with one variable using Scikit-learn
4. Linear regression with multiple variables
5. Using categorical features for machine learning
6. Regression coefficients and feature importance
7. Other models and techniques for regression using Scikit-learn
8. Applying linear regression to other datasets
